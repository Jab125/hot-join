title: Usage with Legacy4J
---
There are 2 ways to use Legacy4J with Hot-Join.

The preferred method is to click the <code><img width={20} height={20} src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jab125/hot-join/refs/heads/develop/docs/.assets/item/hotjoin/start.png" title="Start button" /> Start</code> button on the controller that you wish to use.

The alternative method is to use the `/hotjoinÂ legacy4j` command. Note that when doing so, you will have to setup the controller manually.
